# Keyzilla

As developers, we've all been there: in the excitement of starting a new project, we accidentally commit our .env file to GitHub. Then comes the scramble to remove it and update our git history. This common pitfall inspired the creation of Keyzilla – a tool designed to streamline API key management and enhance security.

## The Problem Keyzilla Solves

Keyzilla offers a centralized solution for managing your API keys, providing a global overview of access permissions. It eliminates the risk of exposing sensitive information in your version control system while simplifying key management across your projects and team.

## How It Works

Keyzilla leverages [Clerk](https://clerk.com) for robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). This choice was deliberate – when dealing with sensitive user data, security is paramount. Clerk ensures that your data is encrypted at rest and in transit, providing the level of protection that users expect and deserve.

## Getting Started with Keyzilla

1. **Ditch the .env**: First, remove that pesky .env file from your project.
2. **Set Up Your Dashboard**: Head to the [Keyzilla dashboard](https://keyzilla.vercel.app/dashboard) and create a new organization (optional) and project.
3. **Manage Your Keys**: Navigate to your project page to add API keys, set access permissions, and specify the environment (server or client) for each key.
4. **On your local machine**: install the keyzilla cli by running `npm install -g keyzilla-cli`

With Keyzilla, you can focus on building your project, confident that your API keys are securely managed and easily accessible to the right team members.
