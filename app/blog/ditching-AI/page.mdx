## Why I Decided to Ditch AI

For a while, I was enamored with AI-powered development tools. After downloading Cursor AI, my productivity skyrocketed. I was accomplishing more than ever before, and it felt incredible. However, a recent experience made me reconsider my reliance on AI.

One day, when my Wi-Fi wasn't working, I found myself struggling to solve problems without AI assistance. I gave up after just a few minutes, feeling frustrated and helpless. This moment of weakness led me to an important realization: no matter how advanced AI becomes, it can never truly replace human ingenuity.

### The Limitations of AI

While AI is undoubtedly powerful, it has significant limitations:

1. Lack of creativity: AI can't think outside the box or generate truly novel ideas.
2. Context understanding: AI struggles to grasp nuanced contexts that humans intuitively understand.
3. Problem-solving flexibility: Humans can adapt their problem-solving approaches in ways AI cannot.
4. Learning from mistakes: The process of making mistakes and learning from them is a uniquely human experience.

### Embracing Human Potential

I considered running a local LLM like CodeSeeker, but I realized that wasn't the solution. The issue wasn't about finding a better AI; it was about rediscovering my own capabilities as a developer and a human being.

By relying too heavily on AI, we risk:

- Losing our ability to think critically and solve problems independently
- Stifling our creativity and unique expression
- Becoming overly dependent on technology for tasks we should be able to perform ourselves

### A Cautionary Theory

Here's a thought-provoking theory: If AI were to become a threat, developers who have become overly reliant on AI assistance might find themselves at a severe disadvantage. We could end up in a situation where we're facing an adversary we don't fully understand and lack the skills to combat effectively.

## Conclusion

While AI tools can be incredibly useful, it's crucial to maintain a balance. We must continue to develop our skills, embrace our humanity, and remember that our unique perspectives and problem-solving abilities are what make us irreplaceable.

By choosing to reduce my reliance on AI, I'm not rejecting progress. Instead, I'm recommitting to my growth as a developer and as a human being. I encourage others to consider their relationship with AI tools and ensure they're not sacrificing their own potential in the pursuit of short-term productivity gains.
