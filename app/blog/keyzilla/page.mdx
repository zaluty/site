# Keyzilla

Commiting .env to github has been a pain for me since i started coding, whenever i have a new project idea i rush a .env file to github and then i have to go back and remove it.
this is where keyzilla comes in, it allows you to manage your API keys in a centralized way and give you a global overview of who has access to what.

## How it works

it uses [clerk](https://clerk.com) to manage RBAC (Role based access) for each member of an organization.
you might be wondering why not use my own custom solution ? well, working with user sensitive data is a big deal and i don't want to deal with that, users want their data secured and encrypted at rest and in transit.

## how to use it

first you need to delete that .env file from your project and head back to [dashboard](https://keyzilla.vercel.app/dashboard), create a new organization(optional) and a new project

then head to the project page add your api keys and choose who has access to what and the API key environement (server | client)
