<Small>CEO (what even is that)</Small>
Since i started coding, i've been commiting .env files to github and always had
a question in mind how do managers keep track of API keys, how do they know who
has access to what?, its true there are tools out there like
[infisical.com](https://infisical.com) but they are complex and meant to be used
by big companies so i build my own minimal software solution check it out here

## Privacify

privacify is meant for people who take their privacy seriously yet lazy to read the privacy policies of every app they use.
it uses [Vercel AI SDK ](https://sdk.vercel.ai) and [gemini](https://gemini.google/) to summarize the privacy policies and tell you if you should use the app or not based on the summary.
here is the [blog post](/blog/privacify) , and the [website](https://privacify-blue.vercel.app)
